# RDR Online Naturalist Tracker

A web app to give you an easier way to track your Naturalist progress than constantly checking the Field Guide and/or Satchel.

## Usage

Click on a habitat to see the animals that are needed for that collection. Once you've sold a sample to Harriet and gotten it stamped, click the "Stamped" checkbox. To keep track up the number of samples you have for each animal, use the +/- buttons next to the number of samples.

Once you turn in the collection, clicking the "Turn in collection" button will reset the stamped status of all animals in that collection. Clicking the "Reset Collection" button will reset all stamps and samples in that collection.

All data is stored in your browser's local storage, so your progress will be tracked between sessions.
